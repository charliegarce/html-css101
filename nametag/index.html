  				Here are true facts about the Tarzier. If you had a staring contest with the 
  				Tarzier it probably wouldn't understand a word you were saying. But it would
  				stare back at you, and you would think that was apropos. The Tarzier would not
  				understand a word you said, and would probably just make a pee-pee.
